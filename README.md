-------What is it? --------------------

A simple web application which:

1. retrieves quote data from the GO Quotes API (https://goquotes.docs.apiary.io/#reference)
2. Allows users to randomly choose a new quote and gives them the option of filtering by category
3. Displays the quote and the Author.


-------What technologies are used? --------------------
HTML & CSS for structure and styling
JSON & Javascript for manipulating the DOM with the relevant data.



-------What else needs to be done --------------------
Make the site responsive for small screens
fix the styling so elements dont move depending on the length of the quote
